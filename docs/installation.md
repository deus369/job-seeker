In Python, you don't typically compile source code into a binary file. Instead, Python code is typically interpreted at runtime by the Python interpreter.

However, there are a few ways to bundle your Python code into an executable binary, which can be useful for distributing your application to users who don't have Python installed.

One popular tool for creating a standalone executable from Python code is PyInstaller. Here's how you can use PyInstaller to create a binary for your Python application:

    Install PyInstaller by running pip install pyinstaller in your terminal or command prompt.
    Navigate to the directory containing your Python code.
    Run pyinstaller --onefile yourscript.py in your terminal or command prompt, replacing "yourscript.py" with the name of your Python script.
    PyInstaller will create a "dist" folder containing your executable binary.

The --onefile option tells PyInstaller to bundle your code into a single executable file, which can be useful for distributing your application to users.

Note that there are other tools you can use to bundle your Python code into an executable binary, such as cx_Freeze and PyOxidizer, but PyInstaller is a popular and well-supported option.
